# IntenseLogic

IntenseLogic is a set of libraries used to write a game engine. It's designed
with performance and extensibility in mind.

IntenseLogic has been in development for over two years, and has several games
currently in development which use it.

## Features

 * Deferred shading - allows you to have thousands of lights in a single scene
   with little performance cost
 * Windows, Linux, and OS X support
 * OpenGL 3.1 rendering
 * Focus on being pragmatic - abstractions are used to reduce amount of code,
   rather than as an excuse for bloat
 * Designed to be easy to build anything you need to without making sacrifices
   in performance to match your use case

## Upcoming

See the [trello](https://trello.com/b/pOWMId8i/intenselogic) for current plans.
